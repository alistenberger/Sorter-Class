/**
 * Write three sorting programs, i.e., insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort, and run on randomly generated 100, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 integers to verify the complexity of algorithms. In details,
 * 1.       Write your own program in C or C++ and add step counting instructions at the instruction of comparison, swamping, and additional copying.
 * 2.       Print the sorted results of three algorithms for 100, and 1000 numbers.
 * 3.       Print the counted steps for sorting 100, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 numbers.
 * 4.       Record the computer times and print them for above running as well.
 * 5.       Plot the values of counted steps and computer times in a chart and connect them in curves by using Excel or other graph software.
